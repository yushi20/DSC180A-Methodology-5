### Proposal Prompts
**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** <br>
Using Grad-CAM to find the region of the most important features in an X-ray could potentially help us reduce the image size down to only the important regions to reduce computation and runtime. We can also feed the model with a higher resolution of specific parts for the Neural Nets to learn better. 

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** <br>
A potential project for next quarter would be to utilize LLM in combination with the NN so that it can translate its learned features into medical reports/labels that would describe the case of pulmonary edema so that no human effort is needed to transcribe the X-ray images. Another project idea could be using LLM as well but making an image search algorithm so that medical professionals can put in specific cases of pulmonary edema and the NN would generate X-ray images based on the descriptions. 

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** <br>
I would test everything more systematically and record all intermediate results. Will also work on restructuring my code more to reduce the amount of manual testing needed. 

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** <br>
LLM, combinations of different image augmentations (translation, rotation, cropping, filtering, normalizing), autoencoders (for data compression by extracting key features, which can regenerate the original x-ray)
